# Daylio and Habo Stats

Generate plots and statistics from [Daylio](https://daylio.net/) and [Habo](https://habo.space/) export files.

### Instructions

Put Daylio and Habo export files in this directory named daylio.csv and habo.json.

`daylio.py` and `habo.py` are general use scripts containing helpful functions for working with the output files.


`line.py` and `scatter.py` use these files to generate plots:

`line.py` generates a line graph of Habo habit completion (%) and Daylio mood over time.
`scatter.py` generates a scatter plot of Habo habit completion (%) vs Daylio mood
